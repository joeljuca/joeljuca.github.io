title: About
---

I'm Joel Wallis, a Brazilian software developer from Fortaleza, Brazil. Programming is my hobby since 2002 and my work since 2005. During this time I worked for and with companies from Africa, Central and North Americas, and Europe, both as front-end and back-end developer.

My programming languages are [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [JavaScript](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [PHP](https://php.net), and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org), and I'm currently learning functional programming with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org). I'm also proactive with tools like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org), [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).

I'm also an enthusiastic user of UNIX-like systems, very comfortable with services like [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org), [Nginx](https://nginx.org) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com). [ZSH](http://zsh.org), [tmux](https://tmux.github.io) and [Vim](http://www.vim.org) are frequent tools in my daily hacking.

**The blog**

The main purpose of this blog is to share technical knowledge about software development and Computer Science, and sometimes relevant opinions about things regarding these topics.

Blogging is difficult, and writing relevant and useful content that's easy to consume is really hard and I admire people who get it done quickly. I generally review my articles multiple times before publishing in order to end up with good texts that can last, so you can expect me to write more about things like _the UNIX philosophy_, _how to learn something new_, _how to contribute to Open Source_, etc. rather than _doing X with framework Y_.

Also, [this blog is Open Source](https://github.com/joelwallis/joelwallis.github.io). It's built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I'll be using its [issue tracker](https://github.com/joelwallis/joelwallis.github.io/issues) to manage blogging tasks, so feel free to create an issue to request a blog post about something you want me writing about, suggest content or code improvements, etc. :-)
