It's a quick and easy way to backup your tmuxinator-powered tmux setups. Just
move the `~/.tmuxinator` folder to your Dropbox and voil√†! :-)

Here's how you can do it (assuming that your Dropbox files are located in your
home directory - so its path is `~/Dropbox`):

```
cd ~
mkdir Dropbox/tmuxinator
mv .tmuxinator/* Dropbox/tmuxinator
ln -fs Dropbox/tmuxinator .tmuxinator
```

_PS: you can also use Google Drive, OneDrive or any other cloud-based storage
solution._
