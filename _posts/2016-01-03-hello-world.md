Hi, I'm Joel Wallis, a brazilian software developer. I can't remember how many blogs I created and abandoned. Blogging is difficult, and blogging relevant and useful things is even more! Share knowledge with a language easy to understand is art and I admire people who get it done quickly. But I think I must try again, because I should share my knowledge.

The main purpose of this blog is to share technical knowledge about software development and Computer Science, and sometimes relevant opinions about things related to these topics.

Also, [this blog is Open Source](https://github.com/joelwallis/joelwallis.github.io). It built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I'll be using it's [issue tracker](https://github.com/joelwallis/joelwallis.github.io/issues) to manage blogging tasks, so feel free to create an issue to request a blog post about something you want me writing about, suggest content or code improvements, etc. :-)
